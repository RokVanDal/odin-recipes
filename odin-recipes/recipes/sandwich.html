  <h3>I love this vegetarian “non-chicken” chicken salad sandwich! It’s got everything I love about a chicken salad or tuna salad sandwich, but without the animal protein. On the face of it, it seems almost too simple to be that good. To be honest, I was pretty wowed by how tasty chickpeas are in a sandwich.</h3>

  <p>Mashed chickpeas, which are also called garbanzo beans, are like a blank slate. They assume the   flavors of creamy mayonnaise and piquant mustard and complement the textures of crunchy celery and almonds.

    Finish this sandwich with layers of buttery avocado, tomato slices, and greens to make a main course meal. Plain old lettuce is just fine here, but I happened upon some baby watercress on my shopping day. Its spiciness added a little extra zing to the sandwich.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>


  <ul>
    <li>1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, rinsed and drained
    </li>
    <li>2 ribs celery, diced
    </li>
    <li>2 tablespoons capers, rinsed and drained
    </li>
    <li>3 tablespoons mayonnaise
    </li>
    <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice
    </li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard
    </li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon salt
    </li>
    <li>2 pinches black pepper
    </li>
    <li>4 slices sandwich bread
    </li>
    <li>1/2 avocado
    </li>
    <li>2 tablespoons roasted almonds, coarsely chopped
    </li>
    <li>2 to 4 tomato slices
    </li>
    <li>Handful watercress or other greens, such as lettuce, arugula, or spinach</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Steps</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Mash the chickpeas:<br>
        In a medium bowl with a potato masher, coarsely mash the chickpeas.</li><br>
    <li>Make the filling:<br>
        Add the celery, capers, mayonnaise, lemon juice, and mustard to the bowl. Taste and add a pinch each of salt and pepper.</li><br>
    <li>Assemble the sandwiches:<br>
        Set 2 pieces of sandwich bread on a cutting board. On one slice of bread, mash 1/4 avocado. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper.

        Top with a spoonful of the chickpea salad and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of the almonds. Add a tomato slice or two, greens of your choice, and top with the second slice of bread. Repeat to make the second sandwich.</li>
    <li>Enjoy:<br>
        Slice the sandwich in half or leave it whole and serve with chips or a side salad.

        Leftovers? You may have extra chickpea salad depending on the size of your bread. Enjoy it the next day in a salad, with crackers or on a single slice of bread for a hearty snack.</li>
